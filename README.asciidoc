= el-get

This is a copy of Dimitri Fontaine's el-get emacs pacakge management
system. The purpose of this fork is to point at a stable version that
I can use in my 'production' emacs environment.  For more details, see
the original documentation at https://github.com/dimitri .

== How to Install this version

;; copy/paste this code into your *scratch* buffer,
;; hit C-j, and you have a working el-get.
